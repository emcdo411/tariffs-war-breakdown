# 2025 Tariff Wars: Comprehensive Analysis for Strategic Decision-Making

## 📊 Overview

This repository presents a data-driven analysis of the 2025 U.S.-led tariff escalation under President Donald Trump’s second administration. Designed for strategic modeling in "Situation Room" environments, it evaluates the economic, geopolitical, and supply chain impacts of evolving tariff policies with predictive scenarios and visualizations developed in **R**.

## 🌐 Current State of the Tariff Wars

- **Launch Date:** April 2, 2025 (“Liberation Day”)
- **Policy Framework:** IEEPA + Section 301  
- **Tariff Structure:**  
  - 10% baseline tariff on all imports  
  - 125% on China by April 9  
  - Temporary 90-day suspension for 60+ allies (e.g., EU, Canada)  

**Notable Events:**
- **Market Reaction:** S&P 500 fell 5% on April 2; rebounded 9.5% on April 9  
- **Supply Chain:** Port congestion and 9–16% rise in China–U.S. shipping costs  
- **WTO Forecast:** -0.2% global goods trade for 2025  

---

## ✅ The Good

- **📈 Revenue Boost:** $1.0T–$1.1T over 10 years (excl. NAFTA countries)  
- **📉 Domestic Industry Support:** Steel (25%) and aluminum (25%) protections  
- **🌏 Strategic Leverage:** Incentivized new trade deals with Vietnam and India  

---

## ❌ The Bad

- **💸 Consumer Impact:** +2.3% inflation; $3,800 avg. annual cost per household  
- **🚢 Disruptions:** Cancelled orders, higher freight, warehouse overflows  
- **🎯 Retaliation:** China’s 125% tariffs hit agriculture, tech, and machinery  

---

## ⚠️ The Ugly

- **📉 Recession Risk:** 63% probability per CNBC; JPMorgan sees GDP at 1.6%  
- **📦 Trade Decline:** WTO warns of 1.5% global trade drop if uncertainty persists  
- **🤝 Diplomatic Fallout:** Tariffs on Japan (24%) and South Korea (25%) strain alliances  

---

## 🔄 Trump’s April 9 Pullback – Key Drivers

- **📉 Market Stabilization:** Tech and Dow volatility  
- **🏬 Retail Pushback:** SMBs face 5–30% order loss  
- **🌐 Allied Pressure:** Negotiated carve-outs for auto imports, EU waivers  
- **📊 Strategic Posturing:** Tactical use of tariffs to enable talks  
- **🇨🇳 China’s Defiance:** 125% retaliation forces escalation vs. selective de-escalation  

---

## 🧠 China’s Strategy

- **🛠️ Tariffs:** Coal, semiconductors, gas—politically sensitive sectors  
- **🌍 Export Shift:** Rising trade with Vietnam, EU, Mexico  
- **🪨 Rare Earths:** 72% U.S. dependency; export controls in effect  
- **🤝 Regional Strategy:** Trilateral deals with Japan & South Korea  
- **🏠 Domestic Adaptation:** Post-COVID resilience and export flexibility

## 📉 Economic Impacts – U.S. Outlook

### Short-Term (2025–2026)
| Scenario | Tariff Level | GDP Growth | Inflation | Import Drop |
|----------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Best Case** | 50% on China | 1.8% | +0.2% | -10% |
| **Base Case** | 125% on China | 1.6% | +2.3% | -15% |
| **Worst Case** | 20% baseline | 1.2% | +3.5% | -23% |

### Long-Term (2027–2035)
- **Best Case:** +1% GDP from reshored semiconductors; 0.5% income gains  
- **Base Case:** Slow 1.4% GDP growth; net-neutral on industry  
- **Worst Case:** 1.0% GDP, higher deficits, supply chain exclusion  

---

## 🚚 Supply Chain Dynamics

- **Now:** Cancellations, freight spikes, port bottlenecks  
- **Mid-Term:** Relocation to India/Vietnam (takes years)  
- **Long-Term:** Global decoupling; U.S. may be priced out of efficiency

## 🔮 Predictive Scenarios (2025–2030)

| Scenario | GDP Growth | Inflation | Imports Decline |

- **Ally Exemptions:** Lock in permanent waivers to rebuild trust  
- **Reshore Critical Sectors:** Prioritize semiconductors, energy tech  
- **Diversify Supply Chains:** Incentivize nearshoring (e.g., Latin America)  
- **Mitigate Consumer Impacts:** Expand subsidies or tax relief for SMBs
